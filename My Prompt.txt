You are an expert software architect, data scientist, and machine learning engineer.
I am building a university-level but industry-inspired group project.

Project Title:
AI-Driven Smart Hostel Resource Optimization System

Context:
This is a group project (4 members), but I am the team leader and core developer.
The project must be:
- Real-world problem solving
- Industry-level design
- Database-centric
- AI / Machine Learning as a CORE feature (not optional)
- Fully explainable (viva-safe)
- Git & GitHub based with modular contributions

Problem Statement:
Hostel/mess systems suffer from unpredictable attendance, food wastage, and poor resource planning.
The system should collect historical hostel data, analyze patterns, predict future food demand using machine learning, and generate optimized decisions to reduce wastage and shortages.

Core Requirements:
1. Use Python as the main programming language.
2. Use a relational database (MySQL preferred).
3. Database must support:
   - Proper normalization
   - Primary & foreign keys
   - CRUD operations
   - JOINs and aggregations
4. Machine Learning must be a CORE feature:
   - Regression-based demand forecasting
   - Explainable model (Linear Regression or Decision Tree)
   - No black-box deep learning
5. Include Data Science pipeline:
   - Data collection
   - Data cleaning
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Feature selection
   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
6. Use Python libraries:
   - pandas, numpy
   - matplotlib (optional)
   - scikit-learn
7. ML output must be stored back into the database.
8. Include a rule-based decision engine on top of ML predictions.
9. Generate reports/insights from predictions.
10. GitHub repository must follow modular structure so multiple members can contribute.

Expectations from you (AI):
- Guide step-by-step from beginner level
- Explain concepts simply
- Provide clean, readable Python code
- Help design database schema
- Help design ML pipeline
- Help with Git/GitHub workflow
- Keep everything explainable for viva

Important Notes:
- This is NOT a simple CRUD management system.
- This is a data-driven decision system.
- AI is used as an assistant; I (the student) am the system designer.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Focus on clarity, logic, and real-world relevance.

Start by:
1. Refining the problem statement
2. Designing database schema
3. Designing ML pipeline
4. Providing step-by-step implementation plan
