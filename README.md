# AI-Powered-Smart-Hostel-Resource-Optimization-System

An AI-powered, data-driven system designed to predict hostel/mess meal demand, reduce food wastage, and avoid shortages. By leveraging historical data and machine learning, the system ensures efficient resource management and optimized meal preparation.

## Problem Statement

- Unpredictable student attendance often leads to food wastage or shortages.
- Manual adjustment of meal quantities is inefficient and error-prone.
- Historical data patterns are not utilized effectively for forecasting.
This system addresses these challenges by predicting next-day meal demand and providing rule-based decisions on how much food should be prepared.

## Features

- Historical data collection and storage in a MySQL database.
- Machine Learning-based demand forecasting using explainable models (Linear Regression / Decision Tree).
- Rule-based decision-making based on predictions (e.g., how much food to cook).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), reporting, and insights generation.
- Data visualization and analytics for better understanding of demand trends.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Linear Regression / Decision Tree)
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, mysql-connector-python
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
